I picked a commonly used CNN architecture, the ResNet18, to classify different types of brain tumors in MRI images. This choice was motivasted by the previously demonstrated success of ResNet architectures in image classification tasks. The moderate depth of the network (18 layers) provided a good compromise between classification performance and computational resources.
